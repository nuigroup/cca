Community Core Audio or CCA is a GSoC 2010 project that shares similar GUI to CCV as well as underlying code base. \r\n\r\nThe goal of CCA is to manage voice inputs, convert voice to text, and output resulting messages to network. The preview release of CCA (for Windows) is available for download here. We hope to get feedback from the community on this preview and look forward to the future results.\r\n\r\n[Blog](http://nuigroup.com/log/cca_preview_release/)\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](http://nuicode.com/projects/cca-alpha/repository)\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2010 project\r\n<br/>\r\n[![GSoC 2010](http://db.tt/3SNsY3Nv)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2010)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Jimbo Zhang\t\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Mathieu Virbel\t","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
